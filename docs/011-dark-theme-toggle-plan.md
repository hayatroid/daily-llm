# Dark Theme Toggle Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [x] Add light/dark theme toggle functionality
- [x] Persist user's theme preference using localStorage
- [x] Create smooth theme transitions
- [x] Add toggle button to the header
- [x] Support system theme preference as default

## ðŸš« Non-Goals

- Complex theme variations (e.g., multiple color schemes)
- Server-side theme rendering
- Theme-specific images or assets
- Accessibility features beyond basic contrast requirements
- Custom theme creation by users

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details

### 1. CSS Architecture

- [x] Define CSS custom properties for both light and dark themes
- [x] Use `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
- [x] Implement smooth transitions for theme changes

### 2. Theme Toggle Component

- [x] Create Astro component for theme toggle button
- [x] Use slider design for visual indication
- [x] Position in header for consistent access

### 3. JavaScript Implementation

- [x] Add client-side script to BaseLayout.astro
- [x] Implement theme switching logic
- [x] Save preference to localStorage
- [x] Load saved preference on page load
- [x] Detect system theme preference as fallback

### 4. Color Schemes

#### Dark Theme (One Half Dark palette)

- Background: `#282c34`
- Links: `#dcdfe4`
- Text: `#8b949e`
- Green: `#98c379`

#### Light Theme (One Half Light palette)

- Background: `#fafafa`
- Links: `#383a42`
- Text: `#6c7680`
- Green: `#50a14f`

### 5. Testing Checklist

- [x] Theme persists across page reloads
- [x] Theme persists across different pages
- [x] No flash of incorrect theme on load
- [x] Smooth transitions between themes
- [x] Proper contrast ratios in both themes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

- Use CSS-only solution where possible
- Minimize JavaScript for performance
- Prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- Ensure compatibility with Astro's static generation

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

- [x] Theme toggle works instantly
- [x] No visual glitches during transition
- [x] User preference is remembered
- [x] Both themes meet accessibility standards

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Results

Successfully implemented dark/light theme toggle with the following achievements:

- **Role-based CSS Architecture**: Implemented unified color system with `--term-link`, `--term-text`, and `--term-green` variables
- **One Half Palette Integration**: Applied eye-friendly One Half Dark/Light color schemes throughout
- **Unified Hover System**: Created consistent underline effects for interactive elements while preserving decorative elements
- **Clean Component Design**: Built slider-style toggle with smooth animations and proper positioning
- **Pseudo-element Handling**: Solved complex CSS inheritance issues with heading decorations (`##`, `###`)
- **Performance Optimized**: Zero FOUC with inline theme detection script

### Technical Highlights

- Fixed CSS specificity conflicts without using `!important`
- Implemented `display: inline-block` solution for pseudo-element text-decoration inheritance
- Created scalable role-based color system preventing future inconsistencies
- Added proper theme transitions across all elements
