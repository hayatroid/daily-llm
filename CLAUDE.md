## üìã Documentation Philosophy

### Goals/Non-Goals Pattern

Every document in `docs/` should start with:

1. **Goals** - What this document covers
2. **Non-Goals** - What to defer for later

This helps:

- Focus on core functionality first
- Avoid scope creep
- Ship faster
- Document what we're NOT doing

### Example Structure

```markdown
# Document Title

## üéØ Goals

- Core features to implement now
- Essential decisions to make

## üö´ Non-Goals

- Nice-to-have features
- Future enhancements
- Complex optimizations
```

Remember: **Core first, adventure later!** üöÄ

### Checklist Documentation Pattern

Convert all `docs/` files to implementation checklists when project progresses:

- Use `[x]` for completed items
- Use `[ ]` for pending/deferred items
- Track implementation progress visually
- Update checklists as features are built
- Maintain accountability and visibility

**Example:**

```markdown
## üéØ Goals

Build the core features with:

- [x] Fast static site generation
- [x] Markdown-based content
- [ ] Advanced search features (deferred)
```

This helps:

- **Visual progress tracking** - See what's done vs pending
- **Project retrospectives** - Clear completion status
- **Future planning** - Identify what was deferred
- **Team communication** - Share progress transparently

## üîß Code Quality

### Formatter and Linter

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
npm run format

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

**Pre-commit checklist (MANDATORY):**

- ‚úÖ `npm run format` - Fix formatting (REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ `npm run lint` - Check for errors (REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ `npm run build` - Ensure builds successfully (REQUIRED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You MUST run formatter and linter before every `git push`. This is non-negotiable.

```bash
# Required workflow before git push:
npm run format
npm run lint
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push
```

GitHub Actions CI will automatically check these on every push and will fail if code quality standards are not met.

## üöÄ Project Specific Notes

### Directory Structure

- All conversations go in `content/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Name files as `001-[topic].md`, `002-[topic].md`, etc.
- Daily summaries saved as `summary.md`

### Documentation

- Project specs in `docs/001-project-overview.md`
- Technical details in separate numbered docs

## üìù Content Creation

### Daily Conversation Format

Use this prompt template to generate conversation files:

```
Create a realistic conversation between User and Assistant about [TOPIC].
Format as Markdown with this frontmatter:

---
date: 2024-MM-DD
time: "HH:MM"
title: "[Descriptive Title]"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---

Requirements:
- 2-4 exchanges (User -> Assistant -> User -> Assistant)
- Technical but accessible language
- Include code examples when relevant
- Keep responses helpful and concise
- Topics: web development, AI, programming, tools
```

### Daily Summary Format

Use this prompt template for summary files:

```
Create a daily summary based on these conversations: [LIST_CONVERSATIONS]

Format as Markdown with this frontmatter:

---
date: 2024-MM-DD
conversations: [NUMBER]
highlights:
  - "[Key insight 1]"
  - "[Key insight 2]"
  - "[Key insight 3]"
---

Requirements:
- 2-3 paragraphs max
- Focus on key learnings and insights
- Mention specific technical decisions
- End with "Key Takeaways" bullet points
- Forward-looking final sentence
```

## üìù Commit Rules

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

- `feat: add daily conversation recording`
- `docs: create project overview`
- `fix: correct markdown formatting`

### Guidelines

1. Use present tense ("add" not "added")
2. Keep first line under 50 characters
3. Capitalize first letter
4. No period at the end of subject line
5. Use imperative mood ("add" not "adds")
