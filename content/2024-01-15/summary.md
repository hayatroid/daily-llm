# Daily Summary - January 15, 2024

Today was all about getting the technical foundation right for the blog. Started with **Astro setup** and learned about the minimal configuration needed for static site generation. The key insight was using `getStaticPaths()` for dynamic date-based routing.

Moved on to **design decisions** with a focus on terminal aesthetics. Established CSS custom properties for the color scheme and decided to keep animations minimal for now - just a simple cursor blink effect.

Finished with **deployment strategy** using GitHub Actions. The workflow is straightforward: build with Node 20, upload artifacts, and deploy to GitHub Pages. Important to remember the Astro config needs `site` and `base` properties for proper routing.

## Key Takeaways

- Astro's file-based routing makes date pages simple
- Terminal theme should prioritize readability over flashy effects
- GitHub Pages deployment is mostly automated once configured

Ready to start building the actual pages tomorrow!
