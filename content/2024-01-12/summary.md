Today's conversations focused on **performance optimization** across different layers of the tech stack. Started with React performance issues, diving deep into component memoization and state management patterns. The key insight was keeping state as local as possible and using the right hook for the job.

The database discussion was particularly valuable, covering practical indexing strategies and the importance of monitoring query performance before optimizing. Understanding that indexes come with trade-offs - they speed up reads but slow down writes - helps make better decisions about when and where to add them.

## Key Takeaways

- React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback are powerful but should be used judiciously
- Database indexes should be based on actual query patterns, not assumptions
- Performance optimization requires monitoring and measurement, not guesswork
- Consider the full lifecycle impact: both read and write performance matter

Ready to apply these optimization techniques to real-world performance bottlenecks!
