Today was all about **development best practices** across the DevOps and collaboration stack. Started with Docker containerization, focusing on security-first approaches like non-root users, vulnerability scanning, and proper secret management. The multi-stage build pattern emerged as particularly valuable for production deployments.

The API design discussion reinforced the importance of consistency in RESTful conventions. Key insights included using proper HTTP status codes, standardized error formats, and thinking through pagination and filtering from the start rather than retrofitting later.

Finished with Git workflow strategies, comparing Git Flow vs. GitHub Flow for different team needs. The emphasis on clean commit history through interactive rebase and conventional commits will definitely improve our code review process and debugging capabilities.

## Key Takeaways

- Docker security is layered: minimal images + non-root users + secret management + vulnerability scanning
- API consistency beats perfection - pick conventions and stick to them across all endpoints
- Git workflow choice depends on deployment frequency: Git Flow for releases, GitHub Flow for continuous deployment
- Clean Git history is an investment in future debugging and collaboration

Ready to implement these practices across our development workflow!
